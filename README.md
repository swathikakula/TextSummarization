DailyMail News articles are made avilable by  and the dataset can be accessed using link https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/.
Once the files are downloaded locally,it contains directory containing weburl. It include approximately 10k documents (test data) and 197k documents (train data). The weblinks can be scrapped using data scraping techniques to obtain the text and summaries.
